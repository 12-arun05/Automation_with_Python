# Excel Automation Project:

This project aims to automate Excel data processing and visualization tasks using Python with the help of the openpyxl library for Excel manipulation and chart creation.

# Overview:
Excel files are widely used for storing and analyzing data. However, performing repetitive tasks such as calculating discounts, generating charts, and analyzing data trends manually can be time-consuming and error-prone. This project provides a solution to automate these tasks, saving time and ensuring accuracy in data processing and visualization.

# Features:
 1. Discount Calculation: Users can input an Excel file containing sales data. The program calculates discounted prices based on user-defined discount percentages and updates the Excel file with the discounted prices.

 2. Chart Generation: Users have the option to generate charts (bar charts or line charts) based on the data in the Excel file. They can choose the columns for the x-axis and y-axis data to visualize trends and analyze data variations.

 3. Customization: The program allows customization of chart titles, x-axis titles, y-axis titles, chart types, and chart positions within the Excel file. Users can tailor the charts to their specific data analysis requirements.

 4. User Interaction: The program prompts users to input file names, discount percentages, chart preferences, and column numbers for data visualization. This interactive approach ensures user control and flexibility in data processing and visualization.

# Usage:
 1.Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
 
 2.Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
 
 3.Run the app.py script and follow the on-screen instructions to input file names, discount percentages, chart preferences, and column numbers.
 
 4.View the generated Excel file with updated data and charts based on your inputs.
